The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is different layers of a heterogenous fluid are in relative motion.
Let the density of any point be $\rho + \delta \rho$ and the change in pressure be $\delta p$, and the velocity components are $U + u, v, w$. Thus the governing equations of the perturbation are then
$$
\begin{align}
	\rho \partial_t u + \rho U \partial_x u + \rho w d_zU &= - \partial_x \delta p\\
	\rho \partial_tv + \rho U \partial_xv &= - \partial_y \delta p \\
	\rho \partial_t w + \rho U \partial_x w &= -\partial_z \delta p - g\delta\rho + \sum_s T_s [\partial_x^2 + \partial_y^2] \delta z_s \delta(z- z_s)\\
	\partial_t \delta \rho + U \partial_x \delta \rho &= - w d_z \rho\\
	\partial_t \delta z_s + U_s \partial_x \delta z_s = w(z_s)\\
	\partial_x u + \partial_y v + \partial_z w = 0
\end{align}
$$
where $z_s$ refers to the discontinuity. The streaming is assumed to take place in the x-direction, with the discontinuity occurring in the z-plane. We seek for disturbances in normal modes by assuming a solution:
$$
	e^{i(k_x x + k_y y + nt)}
$$
With this solution, we find that
$$
	\partial_x = ik_x; \partial_y = ik_y; \partial_t = in
$$
Thus, the perturbation equations become
$$
\begin{align}

\end{a}
