The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is different layers of a heterogenous fluid are in relative motion.
Let the density of any point be $\rho + \delta \rho$ and the change in pressure be $\delta p$, and the velocity components are $U + u, v, w$. Thus the governing equations of the perturbation are then
$$
\begin{align}
	\rho \partial_t u + \rho U \partial_x u + \rho w d_zU = - \partial_x \delta p\\ 
	\rho \partial_t 
\end{align}
$$
