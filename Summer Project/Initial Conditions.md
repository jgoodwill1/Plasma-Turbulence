1. Prepare $128^3$ magnetic field initial conditions dataset in k-space (Fourier space) with following properties
	1. Solenoidal
$$
\nabla \cdot B(k) =0
$$
	1. Mean field in z direction
$$
		B = B_0 \hat{z}
$$


	1. omnidirectional spectrum begins at largest wavelength with positive slope until it reaches wavenumber $k_0$ such that it follows Kolmogorov type power law that holds until Nyquist wavenumber
	2. Energy in fluctuations =  1
