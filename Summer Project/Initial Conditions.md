-  Prepare $128^3$ magnetic field initial conditions dataset in k-space (Fourier space) with following properties
	- Solenoidal
		$\nabla \cdot B(k) =0$
	- Mean field in z direction
		$B = B_0 \hat{z}$
	- omnidirectional spectrum begins at largest wavelength with positive slope until it reaches wavenumber $k_0$ such that it follows Kolmogorov type power law that holds until Nyquist wavenumber
	- Energy in fluctuations =  1
		$b_x^2 + b_y^2 = 1$
