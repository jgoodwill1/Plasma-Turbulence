1. Prepare $128^3$ magnetic field initial conditions dataset in k-space (Fourier space) with following properties
	1. Solenoidal
	2. Mean field in z direction
	3. omnidirectional spectrum begins at largest wavelength with positive slope until it reaches wavenumber $k_0$ such that it follows Kolmogorov type power law that holds until Nyquist wavenumber
	4. Energy in fluctuations =  1
